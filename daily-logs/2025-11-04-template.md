# November 4, 2025 - Day 1

### Step 1: Created Salesforce Developer Edition (First Org)
- Completed setup at [https://developer.salesforce.com/signup](https://www.salesforce.com/form/developer-signup).
- Verified email and successfully logged in.
- Salesforce Org Name: Suhas Builds Developer Edition
- Org ID: `00Dg50000016Kye`
- Verified access to **Setup**, **App Launcher**, and the **Lightning Experience** UI.

### Notes
- This will serve as my **primary developer environment** for my personal projects.
- For my **Trailhead** modules and hands-on exercises, I will try to use the existing **Trailhead Playground**.
- If I choose to connect Trailhead Playground and this Dev Org later, I will document the steps and differences.
